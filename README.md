## Description

This project is a bug tracker, which is basically a support ticket forum.

- Our motivation was to make a website where people from the company could submit, post and comment on their own bug tickets or their peers'.
- This project made us realize how useful is to have a forum to help each other with our coding bugs for example.
- This solves the problem of miss comunication and having to deal with bugs and errors on your own.
- We learnt a bit more of everything, like sessions, handlebars and node in itself.
